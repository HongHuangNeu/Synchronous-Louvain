In each folder of graph, folder "original" correspond to the data of sequential Louvain method, folder "previous result" correspond to the result of synchronous Louvain method. folder "synchronous" has nothing important

For example, in "1000_0.85" folder, the result for synchronous Louvain method is in previous_result/synchronous
"1000-0.85-1-2" means the community of 2nd run for the 1st graph
